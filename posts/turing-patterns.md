### What does the formation of galaxies have to do with oceanic migratory patterns and embryos? The answer may surprise you: Alan Turing.

If you’re interested in math, you probably already know Alan Turing, and if you don’t, you should. Alan Turing was an ingenious mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptist. He is without doubt the forefather to computers, artificial intelligence, algorithms, and theoretical computer science, and he utilized his cryptology skills during World War II to help the Allies defeat the Nazis in many key battles, including the longest continuous military campaign of the war, the Battle of the Atlantic. This could easily be a manifesto on Alan Turing’s mainstream contributions, but perhaps one of the most interesting, although shrouded, codes he worked on was that of nature.

Shortly before his death, Alan Turing was working on finding sufficient basis for a mathematical model that comes up again and again in nature. His research was fruitful, but he died soon thereafter and his ideas were more or less lost up until recently. Turing's focus was _reaction-diffusion systems_, and if that sounds scary, don’t worry too much—they’re not as bad as they may sound.


#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reaction-Diffusion Systems:</span>

  >Systems involving constituents locally transformed into each other by chemical reactions and transported in space by diffusion. They arise, quite naturally, in chemistry and chemical engineering but also serve as a reference for the study of a wide range of phenomena encountered beyond the strict realm of chemical science such as environmental and life sciences.

More simply put, reaction-diffusion systems model the interactions of often naturally produced systems, in which a multitude of things exist and where almost always the interactions of substances lead to the creation of new substances, or the change of previous ones.

In his last paper—written 3 years before his passing—_[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf)_, Turing detailed research into the interaction between molecules which he referred to as _[morphogens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/morphogen)_ and his theorizations of possible mathematical explanations for natural phenomena, namely reaction-diffusion systems.

#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Morphogenesis:</span>

  >Morphogenesis is the biological process that causes a cell, tissue or organism to develop its shape. It is one of three fundamental aspects of developmental biology along with the control of tissue growth and patterning of cellular differentiation.

He went into great detail on how patterns, especially those we observe in nature, arise from initial homogenic states. These patterns have since become known as ‘Turing patterns’ and they’ve been noted in anything from fish scale pigmentation to photoisomerization in dye-doped crystalline structures. He noted in the paper the now-commonly-known pattern of fibonacci numbers in sunflowers, a phenomenon first observed by one of the most important astronomers of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, Johannes Kepler.


### Where are we now?

Research groups are picking up where the Math Goliath left off and they're investigating where exactly these patterns, modeled by the reaction-diffusion theory of morphogenesis, appear. What they've found is absolutely incredible; these patterns arise from the macro to the micro, from the formation of entire galaxies to oceanic migratory patterns to the formation of embryonic structures.

One of the most recent and fascinating applications of research into these prevalent patterns is in whale sharks in the Maldives, a small archipelagic country in South Asia. A short film called [“A Natural Code”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c_8ksn8YaM) documents the Maldives Whale Shark Research Programme (MWSRP), a charity that carries out the research there. Their focus is the conservation and protection efforts of their non-mammalian neighbors, whale sharks.  The beauty of this technique is that the beautiful spot patterns on these sharks can and has been modeled using Turing patterns. The MWSRP leverages this and the fact that each whale shark has a unique spot pattern to track individual sharks. All they have to do is get photos of them from all sides and insert them into their database, in effect creating and storing shark fingerprints. The benefits of such an approach is that it is harmless to the shark, there is no need for any sort of physical tracker, it lets researchers track the sharks for the entirety of their life, these spot patterns remain constant for whale sharks’ adult life, and it’s entirely safe—these sharks, while menacingly giant, are absolutely harmless to people. This means MWSRP can have volunteers help them out with their work, I myself am hoping to join them this summer for a two week volunteer session, and you should [check them out](https://maldiveswhalesharkresearch.org/research/) too!

These patterns don’t only model the behavior of microcosms though; these Turing patterns have been found in the macro of the macrocosms, galaxies. Once again, the rational comes down to morphogens and their interactions in a state of equilibrium. In short, there are two entities; one is an _activator_ and the other an _inhibitor_. The activator _encourages_ production of itself whereas the inhibitor _inhibits_ production of the activator. However, if the two are at equal rates, in effect keeping one another in check, then according to Turing, there are a certain set of circumstances in which the equilibrium may tip to one side, and under these circumstances it can continue to tip more and more to that side. This enables one of the two entities to ‘take over’, which is how these patterns are formed. This process is theorized to be the way galaxies take form, which explains the arisal of Turing patterns in these magnificent gargantuan spirals.


### What next?

Turing’s work, even in the last years of his life, was groundbreaking. Before him, and perhaps without him, few would think to ask or investigate mathematics in nature, especially on such a broad scale. His work largely dictates a magnificent portion of our modern lives: the incredibly complex silicone-chipped machines that we rely on for so much of our professional and personal lives, the algorithms that run them, the cybersecurity that protects them from malicious attacks, and so much more. Beyond that, he clearly has had a significant impact into biomathematics, impacting not just the lives of members of our species but so many beyond us, providing a fantastic mathematical insight into the intricacy and beauty of life. Perhaps our generation and those beyond ours can continue to marvel at the absolute brilliance of the man, and build on the incredible work he has inspired.
